            Career has another definition as well, though. It also refers to the
            progress and actions you have taken throughout the working years of
            your life, especially as they relate to your occupation. It is
            comprised of the different jobs you have held, titles you have
            earned and work you have accomplished over a long period of time.
            When viewed in this context, a career includes everything related to
            your career development, including your choice or profession and
            advancement. Your single career could include a variety of different
            paths.

          <p>
            In order to help you understand how career paths can progress, it
            can be helpful to review career paths for a variety of different
            careers. Be aware that some career paths, like those that advance
            within one occupation, are direct and others are indirect and can
            involve working in different industries or different types of
            jobs.<br />
